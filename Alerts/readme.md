# Introduction
[Azure Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview) can be used to proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data.  After setting up either [metric alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview) or [log alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log) for your workloads, specifically IaaS workloads, there may be times when you need to disable those alerts during a maintenance window.  Depending on the size of your environment and the number of alerts youâ€™ve created, it might be quite a chore to go through each one to disable/enable. 

The following will demonstrate how to setup an Azure Automation Runbook to quickly set the status of our IaaS Alerts to either Enabled or Disabled via a webhook.  The webhook will allow us to execute the Azure Automation Runbook from anywhere, like an on-premises workstation, to set the alert status.  The runbook will also take advantage of Azure Resource Graph as a mechanism to search for alerts across all of the available subscriptions.
